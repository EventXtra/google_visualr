### Development

We use [appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) to test against
multiple rubies and rails versions.

Run `appraisal install` to install all dependencies (See files under `gemfiles`
folder).

Run `appraisal rake` for tests with all versions of Rails.

Run `appraisal 4.1 rake` for tests with Rails 4.1.
